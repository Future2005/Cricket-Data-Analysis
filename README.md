# 🏏 T20 Cricket Data Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing T20 cricket match data to uncover player and team performance insights using data visualization techniques. The dataset, originally in JSON format, contains ball-by-ball details of T20 matches. The data was cleaned and converted into CSV using Python, then visualized through a Power BI dashboard (screenshots included).

The goal of this project is to:

* Understand player performance metrics (e.g., strike rate, economy, runs, wickets)
* Identify top-performing batsmen and bowlers
* Compare players across seasons
* Analyze match outcomes and trends over time



### 📊 Dashboard Highlights
